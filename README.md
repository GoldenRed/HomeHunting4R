## Background:
Rewina has been looking for a place to stay. She has visited multiple places, but one of the issues is that she hasn't been able to know beforehand if the place is close to a University of Maryland College Park Shuttle Bus Station or not. This project was started to remedy that.

## Comma-Separated-Value (CSV) Formatting:

The list_of_stations.csv file makes use of semi-colons to separate the information in the following way:

- The bus station identification number in the NextBus System
- The bus station number in its respective bus line 
- The name of the bus station
- ~~Add the longitutude and latitude values of each station as two semi-colon separated value.~~

## Bus Lines Covered:
As of today (2019-09-15), the following bus lines are available and have been saved in the CSV file. Note that some of these bus lines are subject to change in the SPRING semester, and this projcet is only applicable to the FALL semester. The hope is that Rewina will have found a room by before then.
